# {{ page.title }}

* The best solution to a problem is not to have it.

* An insufficiently ugly temporary hack is permanent.

* There is no such thing as standby infrastructure: there is stuff you always use and stuff that won't work when you need it.

* The first fallacy of automation is making machines perform each step of a manual human process.

* These are not features: Security, Availability, Performance.
