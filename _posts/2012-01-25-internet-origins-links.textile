h1. Origins of the Internet
h2. Fundamental Publications

I've had a long interest in the origins of the Internet, both the people and the seminal publications.  A few years ago I put together a short presentation on some of that history and how it might relate to the evolution of the cloud:

<div style="width:425px" id="__ss_1273352"> <strong style="display:block;margin:12px 0 4px"><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/benjaminblack/network-history-for-clouds" title="some highly selective internet history" target="_blank">some highly selective internet history</a></strong> <iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/1273352" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe> <div style="padding:5px 0 12px"> View more <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/" target="_blank">presentations</a> from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/benjaminblack" target="_blank">Benjamin Black</a> </div> </div>

I thought folks might be interested in some of the original publications directly or indirectly referenced in that presentation, so I've collected them here.  Please contact me if you have copies of PDFs you think are missing from my list (especially Leonard Kleinrock's work).
