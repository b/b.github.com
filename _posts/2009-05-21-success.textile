I have thought for some time, though only recently managed to crystalize the ideas into such simple form, that there is a significant gap between how people (and companies) succeed:

and how people think people (and companies) succeed:

The space between is filled by the "diet books of the business world":http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/04/12/luck_inc/ .  In individuals, the disconnect on how they succeeded is prevalent among the beneficiaries of the various technology company millionaire factories.  Those who recognize the importance of hard work and discipline go on to continued success, while those who come to believe the main driver for their success was just their own talent achieve little but frustration.

I have no deep research to support my claims.  They are, however, distributed free of charge, giving them a much better ROI than any business book.  Think i'm getting it wrong?  Contact me and let me know how!
